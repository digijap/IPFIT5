This is a school project. It is an implementation of whoosh (a pure python full text indexing, search and spell checking library) with flask to show the result in a front end.
It's one of the first coding projects I did so if you're looking through this, I really had no idea what I was doing and copied most things and it just worked. Maybe if I feel like it I would update this.
